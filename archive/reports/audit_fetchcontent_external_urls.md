# Audit: External FetchContent_Declare URLs in TheRock Submodules

**Date:** 2026-03-31
**Trigger:** Linux builds broken — `otf2-3.0.3.tar.gz` download from
`perftools.pages.jsc.fz-juelich.de` failing. See
https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-systems/actions/runs/23811724588/job/69400353587

## Background

TheRock's `third-party/` directory uses `therock_subproject_fetch` with URLs
mirrored to `https://rocm-third-party-deps.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/`. This
provides hermetic builds with no dependency on external servers. See
`docs/development/git_chores.md` § "Updating a third-party mirror".

However, code inside git submodules (`rocm-systems/`, `rocm-libraries/`,
`compiler/`, `iree-libs/`) uses raw `FetchContent_Declare` with URLs pointing
to external servers (GitHub, university hosts, etc.). These bypass TheRock's
mirror infrastructure entirely.

## Summary

- **~70+ external FetchContent_Declare calls** across submodules
- **1 non-GitHub URL** (the broken one): `perftools.pages.jsc.fz-juelich.de`
- **~10 dependencies already mirrored** in `third-party/` but re-fetched from
  GitHub by subproject code (googletest, fmt, Catch2, flatbuffers,
  nlohmann-json, yaml-cpp, libdivide, etc.)
- **~14 locations** fetch `rocm-cmake` from GitHub (should be provided by
  super-project)

## iree-libs

IREE has its own dependency management. These are lower priority for TheRock
since IREE is somewhat self-contained, but they still affect build hermeticity.

## Prioritization

### P0 — Build-breaking (fix now)

- **otf2**: Mirror `otf2-3.0.3.tar.gz` to S3, patch
  `rocprofiler-sdk/external/otf2/CMakeLists.txt` to use the mirror URL.

### P1 — Already mirrored in `third-party/` (low-effort wins)

These dependencies are already on S3 via `third-party/`. Subprojects fetch
their own copies from GitHub. Could be fixed systematically with
`FETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_*` or `FETCHCONTENT_URL_*` overrides at the
super-project level, or by ensuring `find_package` resolves first.

Current `third-party/` contents for reference: boost, Catch2, eigen, fftw3,
flatbuffers, fmt, frugally-deep, FunctionalPlus, googletest, grpc, host-blas
(OpenBLAS), libdivide, msgpack-cxx, nlohmann-json, openmpi, simde, spdlog,
SuiteSparse, yaml-cpp.

Subproject fetches that duplicate these mirrors:

- googletest (~11 locations)
- fmt (2 locations)
- Catch2
- flatbuffers
- nlohmann-json
- yaml-cpp
- libdivide
- boost (rocprofiler-systems/cmake/DyninstBoost.cmake)
- spdlog (hipdnn/cmake/Dependencies.cmake)

### P2 — Not yet mirrored (need S3 upload + patch or override)

- nanobind, cereal, perfetto, mongoose, curl, lapack, getopt, benchmark,
  check, pybind11

### P3 — rocm-cmake (structural)

~14 subprojects fetch rocm-cmake from GitHub. The super-project should provide
it via `find_package`. These fetches should be no-ops if the super-project
build is used, but they're a problem for standalone subproject builds and add
unnecessary network dependency.

### P4 — IREE ecosystem (lower priority)

IREE manages its own deps. Fixing these requires coordination with the IREE
project. Less likely to affect core ROCm builds unless IREE components are
enabled.

## Fix Strategies

1. **Mirror + patch** (per-dependency): Upload tarball to S3, apply a patch
   via TheRock's `patches/` system to rewrite the URL. Works for any dep but
   doesn't scale well.

2. **CMake overrides** (systematic): Set `FETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_<name>` or
   use `FetchContent_Declare(<name> OVERRIDE_FIND_PACKAGE)` at the
   super-project level. This redirects subproject fetches to TheRock-provided
   packages without patching submodule code. Requires that TheRock's
   `third-party/` provides the dependency.

3. **Upstream fixes**: For ROCm-owned subprojects (rocm-systems,
   rocm-libraries), contribute patches upstream to use `find_package` with
   fallback to `FetchContent`, so the super-project can inject dependencies.

4. **Network policy**: For CI, could use a caching proxy or firewall rules to
   detect/block unexpected external fetches during build. This is defense in
   depth, not a fix.

Strategy 2 is the best scaling approach for P1 dependencies. Strategy 1 is
needed for P0 (otf2) and P2 dependencies. Strategy 3 is the long-term fix.
