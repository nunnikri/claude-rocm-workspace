# Submodule Bisect Tooling

- **Status:** In progress
- **Priority:** P1 (High)
- **Started:** 2026-01-09
- **Target:** TBD

## Overview

Build tooling to bisect regressions in ROCm super-repos (rocm-libraries/rocm-systems) using pre-built CI artifacts instead of rebuilding TheRock at each commit. This will reduce bisection time from hours/days to minutes.

**Current Phase:** Prototype & Validation (Phase 1)

## Goals

- [ ] Complete RFC design refinement
- [ ] Implement Phase 1: Working prototype
  - [ ] `workflow_mapper.py` - GitHub API integration with `InMemoryRunStore`
  - [ ] `artifact_manager.py` - Basic artifact download and caching
  - [ ] `setup_test_env.py` - Environment setup
  - [ ] `bisect_submodule.py` - Basic orchestrator (manual mode)
  - [ ] Cache directory structure
  - [ ] Manual end-to-end test with a known regression
- [ ] Validate design with real-world usage
- [ ] Plan Phase 2: Git Bisect Integration

## Context

### Background

When test regressions occur in ROCm super-repos, developers need to identify which commit introduced the failure. Traditional `git bisect` requires rebuilding TheRock at each commit (hours per commit), making it prohibitively expensive.

The super-repos already run TheRock CI workflows that:
- Build TheRock for every commit on develop branch
- Upload artifacts to S3 buckets
- Run component tests

These artifacts can be leveraged for fast bisection without rebuilds.

### Related Work

- RFC: `../TheRock/docs/rfcs/RFC0009-Submodule-Bisect-Tooling.md`
- Discussion: https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock/issues/2608
- Inspiration: IREE bisect tools (https://github.com/iree-org/iree/tree/main/build_tools/pkgci/bisect)

## Investigation Notes

### 2026-01-09 - Design Refinement

**Changes to RFC:**
- Restructured "Detailed Design" to focus on high-level components first, then implementation details
- Introduced pluggable `RunMappingStore` protocol for commit→run_id mappings
- Specified `InMemoryRunStore` as initial implementation (no SQLite dependency)
- Moved persistent storage (SQLite/remote DB) to Phase 4 enhancements
- Updated implementation plan to focus on phases rather than fixed timelines

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Start simple with in-memory storage to validate the approach
- Build abstraction layer early to enable future storage backends
- Keep `<commit_sha>` in cache directory structure for clarity
- Phase 1 focuses on manual mode; Phase 2 adds `git bisect run` integration

**Workflows to Check:**
- `.github/workflows/therock-ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/therock-ci-linux.yml`
- `.github/workflows/therock-ci-windows.yml`

**Prototype Results** (2026-01-09):

Created `prototypes/query_workflow_runs.py` to query GitHub API for workflow runs.

Key findings:
- ✓ **All 19 commits have therock-ci.yml workflow runs!**
- ✓ All runs completed successfully (status: completed, conclusion: success)
- ✓ Successfully mapped each commit to its run_id
- ✓ GitHub API `head_sha` parameter works perfectly for filtering runs by commit
- ✓ Used `gh` CLI for authenticated access (no token management needed)

Example mapping:
- Commit `3568e0df` → Run ID `20723767265`
- Commit `050e88ee` → Run ID `20784068010`

**Design Validation:**
- The RFC's approach of querying workflow runs by commit SHA is validated
- The `head_sha` filter makes queries efficient (no need to paginate through all runs)
- 100% coverage: Every commit in our test range has artifacts available for bisection

**S3 Artifact Structure:**

Artifacts are uploaded to S3, not GitHub artifacts:
- Bucket: `therock-ci-artifacts-external` (for external repos like rocm-systems)
- Path structure: `ROCm-rocm-systems/{run_id}-{platform}/`
- Artifact index: `index-{artifact_group}.html` (e.g., `index-gfx94X-dcgpu.html`)

Example URL:
```
https://therock-ci-artifacts-external.s3.amazonaws.com/ROCm-rocm-systems/20723786674-linux/index-gfx94X-dcgpu.html
```

**Components Built (rocm-systems therock-ci.yml):**

From run 20723786674, artifact group `gfx94X-dcgpu`:
- AMD LLVM (compiler toolchain)
- Base (core system libraries)
- Core-HIP, Core-OCL, Core-Runtime
- Core-HIPTests (GPU-specific tests for gfx94X)
- ROCProfiler (compute, SDK, systems variants)
- Third-party deps (FFTW3, Flatbuffers, Fmt, Nlohmann-JSON, Spdlog)

**CRITICAL GAP IDENTIFIED:**

rocm-systems CI builds only a **subset** of ROCM components. The failing tests mentioned in PR #2812 are for rocprim, which is **not** included in rocm-systems artifacts.

This means:
- We can bisect rocm-systems commits that affect the components actually built (HIP, runtime, profiler, etc.)
- We **cannot** bisect regressions in downstream components like rocprim using only rocm-systems artifacts
- Need to support multiple bisect modes to handle partial artifact coverage

**Design Decision: Two Bisect Modes**

To handle partial artifact coverage, we'll design for two modes:

**1. Lightweight Mode (Repackaging)**
- Use pre-built artifacts directly without rebuilding
- Repackage ROCm with substituted components from different commits
- Fast: No compilation, just download and repackage
- Works when: Downstream components don't need rebuilding against new libraries
- Example: Test rocprim against different HIP runtime versions without rebuilding rocprim

**2. Heavy Mode (Bootstrap + Rebuild)**
- Use `build_tools/buildctl.py` to bootstrap build directory with available artifacts
- Download pre-built components (AMD LLVM, Core runtime, etc.)
- Build missing/test components from source (rocprim, rocBLAS, etc.)
- Slower: Requires compilation but still faster than full TheRock build
- Works when: Downstream components must be rebuilt against new libraries
- Example: Bisect through commits where HIP API changes require rocprim rebuild

**Advantages:**
- Flexibility: Handle both shallow and deep regressions
- Scalability: Lightweight mode can run on many low-powered machines in parallel
- Practicality: Heavy mode available when lightweight isn't sufficient
- Incremental: Can implement lightweight first, add heavy mode later

**Implementation Considerations:**
- ArtifactManager needs to support both download-only and bootstrap modes
- Test scripts may need to specify which mode they require
- Heavy mode needs access to source code (git submodules) for building
- Both modes need GPU access for testing

**Next Steps:**
- [x] Query GitHub API for workflow runs for each commit
- [x] Build commit→run_id mapping
- [x] Check if all 19 commits have workflow runs
- [x] Explore S3 artifact structure and what's built
- [x] Design dual-mode approach for artifact coverage
- [ ] Prototype lightweight mode (repackaging) first
- [ ] Document buildctl.py integration for heavy mode (future)

### 2026-01-09 - GitHub Comment Alignment

Posted status update at https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock/issues/2608#issuecomment-3730778813

**RFC Additions Based on Comment:**
- Added "Future Work: CI-Orchestrated Bisection" section
- Documented benefits (infrastructure reuse, parallelism, consistency)
- Documented challenges (orchestration complexity, feedback loop, resource contention)
- Framed as complementary to local bisection, not a replacement
- Strategy pattern: `LocalBisectStrategy` vs `CIBisectStrategy`
- Added "Detailed Workflow" subsection with 5-step process:
  1. Create bisect commit (update submodules)
  2. Push to shared repo (branch cleanup concerns analyzed)
  3. Trigger workflow via GitHub API
  4. Await results (4 options: polling, webhooks, checks API, artifacts)
  5. Record results and continue

**Key Insights from Comment:**
- Local machine has hardware/OS constraints
- Need caching for "upwards of 10 different sets of artifacts side by side"
- PyTorch testing is a separate concern
- CI-based approach enables automated regression detection at scale

**Branch Cleanup Analysis:**
- 10-20 bisect commits = 10-20 branches in shared repo
- Proposed strategies: automatic, time-based, reference-counted, ephemeral repo
- Trade-offs documented between simplicity and pollution

**Awaiting Results Options:**
- Polling (simple, recommended for MVP)
- Webhooks (efficient but requires infrastructure)
- Checks API (hybrid approach)
- Artifacts (async, auditable)

### TODO: End-to-End Validation Experiment

**Goal:** Validate the local bisect approach with real artifacts and tests to determine practicality vs CI-based approach.

**Experiment Steps:**

1. **Fetch artifacts from boundary commits:**
   - Oldest commit: `3568e0df` (run ID `20723767265`)
   - Newest commit: `050e88ee` (run ID `20784068010`)
   - Download artifacts from S3 for both runs
   - Measure: download time, compressed size, extracted size

2. **Set up test environments:**
   - Extract artifacts to test directories
   - Set up env
     - Configure environment variables (ROCM_PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc.)
     - Verify artifact structure and completeness
     - Document any missing components or dependencies
   - OR Build from source or repackage artifacts so tests can be run

3. **Attempt to reproduce test failures:**
   - PR #2812 mentions rocprim test failures on gfx94X Linux
   - Try running the failing tests with both artifact sets
   - Note: rocprim likely not included in artifacts (identified gap)
   - Measure: test execution time for available tests

4. **Measure performance metrics:**
   - **Download time:** How long to fetch ~10 artifact sets?
   - **Disk space:** How much storage needed for cache?
   - **Test time:** How long do tests take to run locally?
   - **Setup overhead:** Time to extract and configure environment?

5. **Identify edge cases:**
   - Missing dependencies (system packages, GPU drivers)
   - Artifact compatibility issues (library versions, ABIs)
   - GPU availability requirements (can tests run on CPU?)
   - Environment pollution (conflicting ROCm installations)

**Success Criteria:**

- [ ] Successfully download and extract artifacts for both commits
- [ ] Understand complete artifact structure and what's included
- [ ] Identify what tests can/cannot be run with available artifacts
- [ ] Collect performance data to inform local vs CI decision
- [ ] Document any blockers or edge cases

**Expected Learnings:**

- Is local bisection practical given download/test times?
- What's the developer experience like?
- Does the artifact-based approach actually work end-to-end?
- What percentage of regressions can we bisect with partial artifacts?

**Risks:**

- May require GPU hardware not available locally
- Artifacts might not be sufficient to run any meaningful tests
- Could discover fundamental issues with the approach

**Time Estimate:** 2-4 hours for full experiment

**Priority:** High - validates core assumptions before significant implementation

### Next Investigation Areas

- [ ] Study existing `fetch_artifacts.py` to understand artifact download patterns
- [ ] Explore GitHub Actions API for workflow run queries
- [x] Identify a real regression in rocm-libraries or rocm-systems for testing
- [x] Prototype workflow mapper with real API calls

## Decisions & Trade-offs

### In-Memory vs Persistent Storage (Phase 1)

**Decision:** Use in-memory `InMemoryRunStore` for initial implementation

**Rationale:**
- Simplifies initial development (no SQLite dependency)
- Faster iteration during prototyping
- Still provides abstraction for future migration
- Single bisect session can query GitHub API once and cache in memory

**Alternatives considered:**
- SQLite from the start: More complexity, harder to test, overkill for prototype
- No abstraction: Would make future migration harder

### Cache Directory Structure

**Decision:** Use `~/.therock/bisect/<repo>/<commit_sha>/` structure

**Rationale:**
- Commit SHA is more intuitive for debugging
- Easier to manually inspect cached artifacts
- Aligns with git workflow (users think in commits, not run IDs)

**Alternatives considered:**
- Using `run_<run_id>`: Less intuitive, harder to correlate with git history

## Code Changes

### Files to Create (Phase 1)

### Testing Strategy

Phase 1:
1. Unit tests for each component
2. Manual end-to-end test with a known regression

Phase 2+:
3. Automated end-to-end tests with CI artifacts
4. Integration tests with `git bisect run`

## Blockers & Issues

### Active Blockers

None currently

### Questions to Resolve

- [ ] Which super-repo should we use for initial testing?
- [ ] Do we need a test ROCm environment with actual GPUs for validation?
- [ ] Should Phase 1 include basic logging/debugging output?
